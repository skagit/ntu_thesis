This repository was initially used for the doctoral thesis of Matthew Lou-Magnuson. The numbering convention on the folders corresponds to chapter/sections of the dissertation itself for easy cross-reference. The high-level model described in Lou-Magnuson & Onnis (2018) can is in the 2.3-3.5 folder, while the low-level model developed in Lou-Magnuson (2018) is inside the 3.6.1-3.6.2 folder.

Each folder contains the source code in .jl files, with the top level point of entry being the main.jl file. All data analysis code is contained in an analysis.r file, and pseudo-code descriptions of the main algorithms are provided in the pseudocode folder. The organization of a given model is explained in the corresponding exposition.txt file, which also provides context for the pseudo code files.
